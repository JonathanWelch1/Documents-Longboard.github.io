		This hill is located on the east side of Hale Library. The Hale hill is a long hill with a gradual slope. I recommend this hill for beginners or those looking for a nice gentle cruise.

		The Bluemont hill is located on the south side of Bluemont. Bluemont hill is fairly straight with a long, gentle slope. A nice feature about this hill is traffic is one-way in the direction you are riding.

		Cardiac Hill is the most difficult hill currently on the site. It is located on the northeast corner of the quad. The hill starts with a steep incline followed by a double S-shaped path. The most difficult part of this hill is the timing. Cardiac is a high traffic area and requires precision timing to successfully complete. Many people have taken bad spills because of traffic. Our boy did a sicc leg sweep on some pleb that didn't get out of the way.
